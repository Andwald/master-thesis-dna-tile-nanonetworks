We program molecular tube circumferences by specifying the complementarity relationships between modular domains in a 42-base single-stranded DNA motif. Single-step annealing results in the self-assembly of long tubes displaying monodisperse circumferences of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, or 20 DNA helices.}}

  abstract={Nano computation and communication research examines nanosized devices like sensor nodes or robots. Over the last decade, it has attracted attention from many different perspectives, including material sciences, biomedical engineering, and algorithm design. With growing maturity and diversity, a common terminology is increasingly important. In this paper, we analyze the state of the art of nanoscale computational devices, and infer common requirements. We combine these with definitions for macroscale machines and robots to define Nanodevices, an umbrella term that includes all nanosized artificial devices. We derive definitions for Nanomachines and Nanorobots, each with a set of mandatory and optional components. Constraints concerning artificiality and purpose distinguish Nanodevices from nanoparticles and natural life forms. Additionally, we define a Nanonetwork as a network comprised of Nanodevices, and show the specific challenges for Medical Nanorobots and Nanonetworks. We integrate our definition into the current research of Nanodevice components with a set of examples for electronic and biological implementations.}

  abstract={highlight, This paper presents an elaborate scenario to and detect, motivate interdisciplinary computer science involvement in nanotechnology for medical applications. Our scenario illustrates how nanotechnology can be employed to and morbidity, potentially directly treat infectious diseases as a paradigm for human disorders associated with high and mortality. Thus, more precise techniques that monitor the presence and (host-, concentration of critical marker molecules and pathogen-derived) may be applicable at an earlier stage of the disease. Moreover, since the concentration threshold varies from person to person, continuous and diagnostic, individualized monitoring of both and detect, therapeutic measures is required. To and treat diseases directly at the affected location, we propose the usage of an in-body nano network build by nano machines. To report ndings and receive commands from outside of the body, the nano network is connected to a body area network via gateways. In this paper, we discuss the capabilities of nano machinery and architecture., presents the aforementioned network},

  abstract = {The rhizobiome, namely the organisms living in association with a plant's roots, is one of nature's most complex environments. Yet, despite its huge economic and scientific importance, it is poorly understood. Here, a combination of agent-base modeling and molecular communication theory is proposed to construct a game-theoretical computational framework for the simulation of the rhizobiome. The model will use cellular automata to simulate the diffusion of signals in the environment. Molecular communication will provide the theoretical tools for the establishment of an accurate communication model, and game theory will be used to describe all decision-making processes of the model's agents. Such a model should be able to provide insights on the interplay between the various organisms present. Potential applications include crop production, novel antibiotics, and synthetic nanonetworks.},

  abstract = {Oil continues to play a significant role in providing worldwide energy. Impermeable zones (i.e., underground areas that allow only few hydrocarbons-collecting fluids, to pass through) can cause significant challenges during the drilling and oil production periods. The problem of mapping an impermeable area has been investigated mainly using seismic sensors deployed on the Earth surface. The existing solutions continue to be imprecise. In this paper we propose a solution that employs nanodevices enabled with wireless THz communication capabilities. The nanodevices are deployed underground and collected as part of oil exploration and recovery. Wireless connectivity among nanodevices is used for mapping underground flow propagation paths, and implicitly, impermeable areas. Since the deployment underground of nanodevices is costly, in this paper we aim to reduce the number of insertion and collection/production wells. Through simulations, we show that our proposed solution achieves good accuracy in mapping impermeable zones, with a reduced cost.},

This paper discusses the application of DNA self-assembly for manufacturing templates of QCA circuits. Using a synthesis algorithm, a tile set of reduced cardinality is utilized for growing multiple patterns of the same QCA circuit on a two-dimensional template. Errors in the DNA self-assembly process are then considered; their implications on the operation of faulty QCA circuits following the deposition of QCA cells, are discussed. The errors are mostly clustered and along facets; a detailed treatment with respect to manufacturing yield, circuit functionality, error tolerance and growth speed is pursued. As a general conclusion, it is shown that errors are pattern dependent, hence the faults occurring in the assembled QCA circuits are physically and logically different.},

Despite the plethora of technologies existing nowadays, limitations are still present, such as limited speed, low response control, narrow bandwidth, and large dimensions of electronic devices. In this scenario, new engineered materials with unprecedented electromagnetic properties (i.e., MetaSurfaces) can represent a very suitable technology solution.In this paper, a MetaSurface structure is modelled, designed, manufactured and experimentally tested, to be used in several applications. Specifically, results are presented for (i) advanced medical diagnostics, (ii) enhance communication signals along curvilinear paths (i.e., bend optical fibers) and (iii) cloaking applications. Experimental results reveal that the MetaSurface can fully manipulate and process electromagnetic waves at will. The proposed structure appears to be highly versatile and scalable, with great potential to be used for many other practical applications.},

Given the recent developments in the scope of nano machinery, coordination and control of these devices becomes the critical challenge to be solved. In-Body Nano-Communication based on either molecular, acoustic, or RF radio communication in the terahertz band supports the exchange of messages between these in-body devices. Yet, the control and communication with external units is not yet fully understood. In this paper, we investigate the challenges and opportunities of connecting Body Area Networks and other external gateways with in-body nano-devices, paving the road towards more scalable and efficient Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) systems. We derive a novel network architecture supporting the resulting requirements and, most importantly, investigate options for the simulation based performance evaluation of such novel concepts. Our study is concluded by a first look at the resulting security issues considering the high impact of potential misuse of the communication links.}

A simple kinetic pathway is described which results in this proofreading when the reaction is strongly but nonspecifically driven, e.g., by phosphate hydrolysis. Protein synthesis, amino acid recognition, and DNA replication, all exhibit the features of this model. In each case, known reactions which otherwise appear to be useless or deleterious complications are seen to be essential to the proofreading function.}
